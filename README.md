## **Problem Statement**

The agricultural sector depends heavily on environmental factors such as **rainfall, temperature, and humidity**, which directly affect **crop yield**.
This project aims to:

* Analyze climatic patterns across multiple years and regions.
* Understand which environmental factors most influence crop productivity.
* Provide actionable insights to improve crop selection, irrigation management, and overall agricultural efficiency.

## **Steps Followed**

1. **Created Amazon S3 Bucket & Loaded Data**

   * Raw agricultural data was uploaded to **Amazon S3** for cloud storage.

2. **Created IAM Role**

   * Configured a Snowflake integration role to securely access data from S3.

3. **Loaded Data into Snowflake**

   * Imported S3 data into a Snowflake table for transformation and analysis.

4. **Data Transformation using Snowflake SQL**

   * Created a table named **`agriculture`**.
   * Updated the table to:

     * Increase **rainfall** values by 10% (`rainfall * 1.1`).
     * Decrease **area** values by 10% (`area * 0.9`).
   * Added a new column `year_group` and updated it as:

     * `Y1` â†’ Years between **2004â€“2009**
     * `Y2` â†’ Years between **2010â€“2015**
     * `Y3` â†’ Years between **2016â€“2019**

5. **Added Rainfall Groups Column**

   * `Rainfall_Groups` created with ranges:

     * **Low:** 255 â€“ 1200 mm
     * **Medium:** 1200 â€“ 2000 mm
     * **High:** 2800 â€“ 4103 mm

6. **Imported Data into Power BI**

   * Connected Snowflake data source to Power BI for visualization and dashboard creation.

## **Dashboard Analysis**

### **1. Rainfall Analysis**

![Rainfall Analysis](images/Rainfall%20Analysis.png)

#### Overall Analysis

* Displays average rainfall patterns across years, seasons, crops, and locations.
* Average rainfall shows **moderate variation** but remains generally stable between **2700â€“3200 mm**.

#### Key Insights

* Rainfall peaked in **2013â€“2015**, followed by a mild decline.
* **Rabi season** shows consistent rainfall (â‰ˆ3100 mm) â€” ideal for stable crop cycles.
* **Paddy, Arecanut, and Cardamom** require the highest rainfall (3.3Kâ€“3.5K mm).
* **Bangalore** leads with 3.8K mm, while **Mysuru** records the lowest (2.9K mm).

#### Recommendations

* Promote **Paddy and Arecanut** in high rainfall areas.
* Focus **water conservation** and **rainwater harvesting** in drier regions.
* Prioritize **Rabi season** planting for optimal yield consistency.

### **2. Temperature Analysis**

![Temperature Analysis](images/Temperature%20Analysis.png)

#### Overall Analysis

* Shows average temperature variation by year, season, crop, and location.
* Temperature ranges between **55Â°F â€“ 73Â°F**, indicating a generally warm tropical climate.

#### Key Insights

* **Kharif and Zaid** seasons are hottest (~72Â°F), while **Rabi** is cooler (~61Â°F).
* **Ginger (79Â°F)**, **Tea (74Â°F)**, and **Cashew (74Â°F)** thrive in warmer conditions.
* **Chikmagaluru (33Â°F)** and **Mangalore (38Â°F)** show cooler climates, ideal for coffee and pepper.
* **Bangalore (186Â°F)** shows outlier data â€” possible urban heat concentration.

#### Recommendations

* Allocate **heat-tolerant crops** (Ginger, Cashew) to warm zones like Bangalore and Raichur.
* Assign **cool-season crops** (Coffee, Pepper) to Chikmagaluru and Mangalore.
* Implement **shade farming** and **tree cover programs** in high-temperature regions.

### **3. Humidity Analysis**

![Humidity Analysis](images/Humidity%20Analysis.png)

#### Overall Analysis

* Humidity remains stable across all dimensions, averaging **55â€“56%**.
* Indicates a **balanced climate** ideal for consistent crop growth.

#### Key Insights

* Minimal seasonal and regional humidity variation.
* **Cotton, Pepper, Coffee, and Coconut** grow well under current humidity levels.
* **Davangere, Raichur, and Mysuru** all record uniform 56% humidity.

#### Recommendations

* Maintain **controlled irrigation** to avoid excess soil moisture.
* Utilize this **stable humidity** for multi-cropping and year-round production.
* Combine humidity with temperature metrics for precise irrigation management.

| **Rainfall**    | Moderate variation, consistent Rabi season rainfall | Enables predictable irrigation scheduling          |
| **Temperature** | Warmer in Kharif/Zaid, cooler in Rabi               | Influences crop selection and season planning      |
| **Humidity**    | Stable 55â€“56% throughout                            | Ideal for balanced crop growth                     |
| **Yield**       | Higher during Rabi; Cotton & Coconut lead           | Correlates with temperature and rainfall stability |

**Conclusion:**
The data indicates that **Rabi season** provides the best conditions for maximum yield due to **consistent rainfall, moderate temperature, and stable humidity**.
Regions like **Kodagu and Mysuru** should be prioritized for high-value crops, while **Raichur and Davangere** require targeted soil and irrigation improvement strategies.
